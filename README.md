## Project Overview
The Elite Savant Terminal is a gamified "Savant Protocol" simulator. It features 25+ unique mini-games designed to test memory stability, pattern recognition, and mathematical precision.

### Key Features
- **Progressive Difficulty**: 20 levels of scaling complexity per game.
- **Neural Hub**: A centralized state management system (EliteLeagueHub) that tracks progress via LocalStorage.
- **Tactical Briefings**: Contextual "How to Play" instructions for every game sector.
- **Savant Insight**: AI-driven solution analysis and coach advice.
- **Neural Supremacy Cinematic**: An end-game achievement report for players who reach Level 20.
- **Protocol Reset**: A "Hard Reset" feature to purge neural data and restart the career.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict Typing)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Framer Motion for cinematic transitions.
- **Icons**: Lucide-React
- **Database**: LocalStorage for persistent user statistics.

## Architecture
- `/components`: Modular UI elements including the Arena, Sidebar, and HUD.
- `/games`: Categorized game logic (Math, Logic, Spatial, Memory).
- `/services`: Core logic for data persistence and AI integration.
- `/data`: JSON-based tactical briefing database.
